MacSecKey:
  description: |-
    MacSecKey resources contain the necessary details to setup MACsec keys
    on the Channel object. 
    
    A Channel is limited to 2 MacSecKey objects at any one time, and amongst
    the `N` Channels on the respective parent Interconnect, the limit is `N+1`

    When creating the MacSecKey, the `startTime` on the created object MUST
    be set by the server to the current time when the request was accepted.
  example:
    name: name
    cak: MACsec CAK
    ckn: MACsec CKN
    startTime: 2000-01-23T04:56:07.000+00:00
    active: true

        Indicates that this key is active on the respective `channel`. Only one
